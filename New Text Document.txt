Programming CellMen
Materials:
STLinkV2 (Dedicated STM programmer)
A way to connect the CellMan board to the Programmer
A computer with USB (Linux is easier, but a windows machine with cygwin is possible)
The following software:
Small Device C Compiler -- http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/
Stm8flash -- https://github.com/vdudouyt/stm8flash
(In my case, it was necessary to compile these from source)
1. Connect the Power, GND, Reset, and SWIM pins on the J1 connector of CellMan to their
corresponding pins on the Programmer, and the Programmer to the USB port of your
computer.
a. As of right now, no dedicated cable exists for this purpose. It was my intention to
make one, but I find myself unable to at the time of writing this. A set of female
to female jumper wires can be used instead.
b. On later iterations of CellMan, the pins on the J1 connector are not populated. A
good connection can be made temporarily by pressing a set of male pins against
the holes and plugging the jumper wires or cable into these pins
c. If CellMan is receiving external power, the Power pin can and should be omitted.

2. Clone the CellMan firmware source code from Git and make any desired changes

3. Once you are confident that SDCC and STM8flash have been installed correctly and are
in your path, navigate to the CellManfirmware folder in your terminal and run the
following commands.
# make sure both tools are installed correctly
$ stm8flash
$ sdcc
# compile and flash the code
$ make
$ make flash
